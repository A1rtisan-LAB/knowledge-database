- `good first issue` - issues which should only require a few lines of code
- `help wanted` - issues which need extra attention

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code follows the existing code style
6. Issue that pull request!

## Development Process

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/your-username/knowledge-database.git
cd knowledge-database

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original/knowledge-database.git

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Set up pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install

# Run the application locally
./scripts/start-local.sh
```

### Code Style

We use several tools to maintain code quality:

- **Black** for Python code formatting
- **isort** for import sorting
- **flake8** for linting
- **mypy** for type checking

Run all checks:
```bash
# Format code
black app/ tests/
isort app/ tests/

# Run linting
flake8 app/ tests/
mypy app/

# Or run all at once
make lint
```

### Testing

Write tests for any new functionality:

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/unit/test_auth.py

# Run tests in parallel
pytest -n auto
```
